Here's a breakdown of how it works:

The user selects a date and time through the UI.
When the user schedules the notification,  app stores the selected date and time along with the notification message.
At the scheduled date and time,  app triggers the notification to be displayed on the device.
This setup enables  app to serve as a reminder or alarm system where users can set notifications for various events or tasks they need to be reminded of at specific times.
